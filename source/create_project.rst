Create a Sphinx Project
#########################

You can use your fork of the :xref:`Get Started Sphinx Repo` as the start of a new project, or you can create the project by entering the command:

.. code-block:: bash
  
   $ sphinx-quickstart

Work through the prompts. See :xref:`First Steps with Sphinx` for more
information.


Sphinx Project Configuration File
**********************************

When you create a new project with ``sphinx-quickstart``, the project's main
configuration file, ``conf.py`` is generated.  This file contains the settings
that control how your project is generated.

See :xref:`Sphinx Configuration` for information.

The following example shows the commented ``conf.py`` file for this project.

.. literalinclude:: conf.py
 :language: Python
